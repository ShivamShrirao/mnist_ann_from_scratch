# mnist_ann_from_scratch

Artificial Neural Network module made from scratch. Implemented on mnist dataset for 
digit classification.

Acheiving 98 to 99% accuracy on testing and training dataset.

Web Api is currently pretty bad implementation. Makes mistakes many times. Have to 
change the input from drawing board to be similar to as training one.
